                    <h2>Hivemind and DeDLOC - 2021</h2>
                    <p>At the time the Gridcoin Greenpaper was originally drafted in early 2021, training deep learning networks on a widely distributed system architecture like BOINC remained an unsolved research problem.  Since then, the Learning@Home team has published preliminary but highly promising results from their new algorithm: Distributed Deep Learning in Open Collaborations (DeDLOC).  DeDLOC will form the basis of all of Grid Lab's initial applications and experiments.  From their 2021 paper:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "DeDLOC is based on a novel algorithm that adapts to the available hardware in order to maximize the training throughput. Depending on the infrastructure, DeDLOC can recover parameter servers [30], All-Reduce SGD [32], decentralized SGD [33], BytePS [34], or an intermediate strategy that combines all of them. Using this algorithm, we propose a system for collaborative training designed to accommodate a large number of heterogeneous devices with uneven compute, bandwidth, reliability, and network capabilities."

                    <h2>Gridcoin Greenpaper - 2021</h2>
                    <p>This paper takes a close look at the economics of Gridcoin 'Proof of Research' compared to other Proof of Work blockchains and cloud computing in general.  It identified a possible market opportunity that would be mutually beneficial to BOINC based scientific research, the Gridcoin network, and early business participants.</p>

                    <p>Gridcoin is a cryptocurrency built on a Proof of Stake blockchain which rewards participation in BOINC and other scientific distributed computing projects.  It is the reserve asset and currency of choice for Grid Labs.</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin needs no introduction.  We include the original Bitcoin Whitepaper here because it laid the foundation for decentralized, open economic networks like Gridcoin.  That open, trustless coordination technology is quite possibly the greatest invention of this century.
